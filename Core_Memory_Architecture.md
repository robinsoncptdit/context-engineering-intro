## Core Memory Architecture

**1. Semantic Code Graph Database**

* Build a neo4j-based graph that captures relationships between code entities (functions, classes, modules) with semantic embeddings
* Each node stores: code snippet, purpose, dependencies, creation timestamp, and PRP reference
* Edges represent: calls, inherits, implements, modifies, relates-to
* This allows Claude Code to query "What does the authentication system do?" or "Show me all code related to user management"
**2. Progressive Summarization Layer**

* After each session/compact, generate hierarchical summaries:
  * Micro: What was just built (last 10-20 interactions)
  * Meso: Current sprint/feature status
  * Macro: Overall project state vs PRP goals
* Store these as markdown documents with semantic tags for quick retrieval
**3. Decision & Drift Tracking System**

```
decision_log:
  - timestamp: 2024-11-20T10:30:00
    context: "User authentication implementation"
    prp_requirement: "Basic email/password auth"
    actual_implementation: "Added OAuth2 support"
    drift_type: "enhancement"
    rationale: "User suggested better UX"
    impact: ["Added 3 new dependencies", "Modified auth flow"]
    approved: true
```

## Memory Retrieval Strategy

**1. Context Reconstruction Protocol** At session start, Claude Code would:

```
def reconstruct_context():
    # 1. Load project vitals
    current_milestone = load_current_milestone()
    recent_decisions = load_recent_decisions(days=7)
    
    # 2. Semantic search for relevant context
    working_areas = identify_active_code_areas()
    related_code = semantic_search(working_areas, limit=10)
    
    # 3. Build working memory
    return {
        "prp_status": compare_current_vs_planned(),
        "recent_work": progressive_summaries.get_latest(),
        "active_context": related_code,
        "pending_tasks": extract_todos_from_code(),
        "drift_warnings": analyze_deviation_from_prp()
    }
```

**2. Dynamic Context Windows**

* Implement a "context budget" system where different memory types have allocation priorities
* Critical context (current feature, recent decisions) gets 40% of window
* Reference context (PRP, architecture docs) gets 30%
* Historical context (past implementations) gets 20%
* Buffer for new work gets 10%
## Implementation Tools

**1. Memory Environment Structure**

```
project/
├── .claude-memory/
│   ├── semantic-index.db      # Code graph database
│   ├── summaries/
│   │   ├── session-{id}.md    # Per-session summaries
│   │   └── milestone-{id}.md  # Feature completion summaries
│   ├── decisions.yaml         # Decision & drift log
│   ├── context-maps/          # Visual project maps
│   └── checkpoints/           # Full state snapshots
├── prp.md                     # Living PRP document
└── src/                       # Actual codebase
```

**2. Memory-Aware Prompting** Create specialized prompts that help Claude Code maintain awareness:

```
## Current Context Summary
You are continuing work on: {feature_name}
Last session ended: {timestamp}
Progress: {completion_percentage}%

## Recent Decisions
{list_of_recent_drift_decisions}

## Your Next Task
Based on PRP section {section_id}, implement: {next_requirement}
Consider these existing implementations: {relevant_code_refs}
```

## Overcoming Specific Challenges

**1. Semantic Drift Detection**

* Embed each PRP requirement using the same model
* Continuously compare implementation embeddings against requirement embeddings
* Flag divergence when similarity drops below threshold
* Prompt for explicit approval when drift detected
**2. Cross-Session Continuity**

* Generate "handoff documents" at session end
* Include: what was built, what's half-done, next steps, open questions
* Start new sessions by reviewing handoff + current code state
**3. Active Memory Curation**

* Implement forgetting curves: deprioritize old, stable code from active context
* Keep "hot paths" - frequently modified or referenced code stays in memory
* Use attention mechanisms: code that was looked at but not modified gets lower priority
**4. PRP Evolution Tracking**

```
class PRPTracker:
    def track_implementation(self, requirement_id, implementation):
        self.log_coverage(requirement_id, implementation)
        self.detect_drift(requirement_id, implementation)
        self.update_roadmap_status()
        
    def suggest_prp_updates(self):
        # Based on consistent drift patterns
        return self.analyze_drift_patterns()
```

This architecture ensures Claude Code maintains both tactical awareness (what am I doing now?) and strategic alignment (where am I going?), while gracefully handling the realities of context window limitations and natural project evolution.
