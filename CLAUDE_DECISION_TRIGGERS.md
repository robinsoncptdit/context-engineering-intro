   - "We should use [new technology]" ‚Üí DECISION
   - "Let's refactor the entire..." ‚Üí DECISION

2. **Deviation from Plan**
   - "Instead of [original plan], let's..." ‚Üí DECISION
   - "Actually, a better approach would be..." ‚Üí DECISION
   - "The PRP says X but we'll do Y" ‚Üí DECISION

3. **Major Dependencies**
   - "Let's add [new library/framework]" ‚Üí DECISION
   - "We need to install..." ‚Üí DECISION
   - "This requires [external service]" ‚Üí DECISION

4. **Scope Changes**
   - "Let's also add [new feature]" ‚Üí DECISION
   - "We should include..." ‚Üí DECISION

## Claude Reminder Template

When Claude detects a decision point, it should say:

```
üìù DECISION POINT: [Brief description]

We just agreed to: [specific change]
This differs from: [original plan/approach]

Should I help you document this decision? 
Run: python scripts/add_decision.py
```
